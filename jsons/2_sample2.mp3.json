"text": " In the last video, you guys gave me a lot of love. It's my pleasure to keep this course free. A like is a must for this free course. You know, when I started web development, this quality was not comprehensive course. Leave free or paid, it was not such course. So I can understand that being free of this course is so important for some people. And trust me, I live up to the expectations. With that said, like this video because we are going to make our first website in this video. In this video, I am going to order iPhone 15 Pro Max. You will see how it is in the next video. For many of you, this will be your first website in your life. So it's going to be very fun. You guys are excited, right? Write in the comments. I am excited. And I will hurt all the comments that I am excited about. I will give my heart. In this video, we will learn to link an HTML website with CSS and JavaScript. Along with that, in this video, I am going to give you guys notes, cheat sheet and many other resources. I will tell you guys some of the such techniques that I have learned in years. And we will literally speed up your web development. In this video, we will also see how to make our VS Code awesome. That your VS Code screen will look like a killer. In this video, I will also tell you how to earn money from web development. So let's start with full energy. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, we have come to our computer screen. Before we move on to the video, I would like to tell you that you should access this playlist. Secondly, we are very close to 5 million subscribers. So if you haven't subscribed yet, do subscribe. In today's video, we will make our first website as I have already told you. So the first thing we will do is to customize our VS Code. So we will make our first website. So the first thing we will do is to customize our VS Code. So this is the folder in which we started our web development series. Now I want to give you guys the source code of this web development series. So I will configure the Git. Now it is not necessary to know about the Git. But I will fire the GitHub desktop here. And here I will add a new repository. I will click on add, create new repository. I will name it Sigma Web Dev Course. And this is our folder. So I will select this folder. Initialize this repository with Readme. And here I will write source code for Sigma Web Development Course. I will click on create repository. This will make a repository called Sigma Web Dev Course. The first relevant things from the first video, I will add them here. These were the files. The first relevant video. I will name it Video1. Right click New Folder. And I will name these files Video1. And I will move these files in Video1 folder. I am not pushing this video on the Git. You can use your sample videos. So now I will update the source code here. And I will push it on the Git. How to push it on the Git. You guys don't need to learn this. But this procedure is very simple. Why do we use Git? I would like to tell you that the Git is used by web developers. We use general coders. When they have to collaborate with their code. Then they have to collaborate with other people. So what will happen is that you guys will work with many programmers. And those programmers will collaborate with your source code. And to do this kind of collaboration. They will also push some code. You will also push some code. Maybe a person is editing a file. A person is editing a second file. So here the GitHub is used. And what is GitHub Desktop? GitHub Desktop is a utility to use Git. Git and GitHub have this difference. Git is an open source. But GitHub is a Microsoft open source. But GitHub is a Microsoft open company. Which is used by using Git. And helps you to host repositories on your web interface. And helps you to host repositories on your web interface. In the upcoming videos about Git. I will tell you more. But I am pushing this repository on my code with her. So you will get the link in the description. The repository. So as soon as I give you the links. You will get the code if you follow it. And I will talk about it later. I am making this video course impact. Like this. So I will click on the Publisher repository. This code. This folder will sync with my GitHub account. So the whole code that I am going to upload. Will go to my GitHub account. And it will sync. The changes here will be there. If someone has changed there. I can pull it here. I can pull it here. I will teach you all this. I will dedicate a video. Don't worry. I will make a video 2 folder. I will go to the inside. I will click on Shift and open with VS Code. So here is open with code. You will get this option. As I said. If you have changed something. And you have not checked. You can have a problem. We will dismiss this. I will make the file here. I will make the index. And that file will be made here. So you all know about it. I know a lot of intermediate people here. We already know everything. But I am making this course. So that all the beginners can follow along. So I will make 3 files here. One I made here. The second file I am going to make. Style.CSS And the third file I am going to make. Script.js And the name of these files can be anything. But I just want to keep these files self-explanatory. So that they can see the name and know what they are doing. Index.HTML file. Script.js. And this is the style sheet. So I made these 3 files here. I will go to index.html and apply the exclamation mark. And as soon as I apply the exclamation mark. You see here this code is here. I will click on view word wrap. So that you can see the code. Horizontal scroll bar is gone. I checked the word wrap. So here you all see. We will understand this code. But for now you can understand that this code. The code of HTML. We use it to make a website. Now let's go to the extension tab of VS Code. For extensions. To enhance the functionality of VS Code. We use extension code to make VS code better. For VS Code, we use code to write. To make it more helpful. So which extension will we use? I will put you in the first one. Some extensions which will make our VS code clearer. If your friend has seen it. He will say yeah. Okay. I will go to the second one. I will do it quickly, VS Code Icons VS Code Icons is an extension called KEEK, which I will install As you know, whatever files you are looking at, it has an icon Earlier, this icon was not available, you can see it in the video Here, you are getting to see all these icons Thanks for installing VS Code Icons I will activate it here And you can see here that these are our icons If you consider that I have made a folder at the time of coming, then this icon will come So, these icons look so good We will come to the extension tab again And here, there are many good themes that you can use Some themes are Jellyfish themes One is GitHub themes, there are many themes You can use these themes, but I can only apply one theme at a time This is the theme of default VS Code, which shows you VS Code in this way Now, if I change my theme, then my VS Code will look in a different way I will show you which one I will prefer when it comes to themes First, I will show you the GitHub theme here This is an official GitHub theme Here, you can see GitHub Dark Here, you can see GitHub Light Here, you can see GitHub DIMMED Here, you can see GitHub Colour Blind I think this one looks better because the colors in this one Sorry, I will choose GitHub Dark because the colors in this one are different Another theme that I will prefer is Jellyfish And here, Jellyfish theme looks good If I install this, then you can see something like this Jellyfish, this is how you see After this, a material theme is also very popular And if I use the material theme here And the material theme icon is the material theme that we have to install If you have installed the material theme icon, then you can change your icons To control which extension And here, we have installed many extensions You can also tell how to delete extensions Here, I am showing the material theme icons And if you want, you can use the VSCode icons If I want, the material themes icon to be removed Then I will simply remove this And here, you can see all my extensions This is the material theme icon And I want to use this one And if I want, I can also uninstall it And sometimes, if we uninstall anything, then reload is required So, I will have to click on reload required And when I click on reload required, then my VSCode will be reloaded So, you can customize your VSCode I will select my VSCode icons here So that I can see my icons like this I like this a little I like Jellyfish theme a lot After this, there is another extension called Prettier I will not install it too But I just want to tell you Another extension is ES7 When we react, you will know And yes, we will react in this course For all those asking Sorry for the spoilers, but we are going to react in this course So, this is ES7 plus ReactRedux React Native Snippets This extension gives you a React Snippets We will use it only when we react We will not install it for now But now, the most important extension is called Live Preview We will install this extension called Live Preview Because it is a very useful extension I have told you all the extensions Mostly, they help you To change the look and feel of the VSCode But today, I am telling you the extension Live Preview, you will actually use it Let's come to our HTML CSS JavaScript files So, these are our HTML CSS and JavaScript files This is HTML file This is some code Which tells you How to see the website Okay So, here I am saying that Document should be in the title I will write here Harry's first website Harry's first website K-Course's first website Harry's first website will be a lie It is your first website You people are writing your name in it Okay, whatever your name is Kee first website And if I write here in the body Hey, this is my first website And everyone write in the comment Congratulations The first website of Jinn Jinn Everyone write congratulations Congratulations for my first website Okay And congratulate each other Make them a atmosphere in the comment section I also come in the comment section Okay And I give you all my heart Hey, this is my first website Now Let me see how it is The biggest question for people So, there are two ways to see it The one which we have installed live server Live Preview, sorry Live server used to work a lot But Microsoft released Live Preview So, I will recommend the latest extension Live server works too But I am not going to run Live Server I am going to use Live Preview After installing Live Preview You can see this icon here But if you click on it Your website will look something like this Now you say, I want to see this website In the browser Because my website will be in the browser So, if you want to see it in the browser Click here Open in the browser This will open in the browser And I will tell you a fun thing Listen to the fun You can close it from here And you can write here Harry's course is good You can write it I am praising my course But yes, that is Harry's course is good Okay, I wrote it here And you noticed one thing I didn't reload this website But after that, it updated this content Which I wrote in this VS Code That is, I will write whatever here Without reloading It will be updated here Will it happen or not? Play the music What should happen for us? Okay, it will happen And here Hey, this is my first website Harry's course is good Now I will write here Sigma Harry's course is good Sigma Harry's course is good Sigma Harry's course is good Okay So, here you saw How this extension helped us If you reload it too It will not make any difference Because it is reloading live There are two things Sometimes we want our page To be here or here I will close it So that you can see the wide code Sometimes we want our code To be here or here Because we want to see Its live preview So, I am writing anything Harry's course is good And this is Sigma course I will write something else I can write many things So, I will write here And I will keep watching And I can also make it small Like this So, I will see the live update here If you have seen my old videos Then I have used this extension Of the live server Or this extension was not there I did not know Whatever it is If something new comes Then it takes time to find out But this is something that you should use Because I use AC in my daily life I do web development Many people ask me Do you also do web development Or do you just teach? I do it I make websites I don't make videos I also do work By making websites And I make money by making websites Now, all the codes I am writing You will get all these on the GitHub So, you will go to any video description Of any video course In any video description You will get the corresponding video code You don't have to worry Now, I will close this Because my preview is visible here Now, understand the HTML, CSS, JavaScript Which we talked about We talked so much about it in the previous video Now, I will tell you how to link these three Now, you will say Okay, you made index.html It is very good You can see the title here Look here, the course of Harry by K First website I know that I will do the course of Sigma Web Development So, this will be changed Sigma Sigma Web Development Course Here, I have written Sigma Web Development Course And you can see here That this has been updated So, this will keep on updating It will be a live update Now, I want my background to be red Okay This kind of work is done by CSS So, I can write here Body And background color Red Okay, this is the syntax of CSS I will read CSS And I will read it so that you won't be able to forget it Don't worry This is written here Understand, this is CSS Which reds the color of the body Okay And here, you see Will the color of the body be red or not? Tell me in the comment section Now, I will tell the beginners that it won't be red Okay, why not? The beginners will feel that it will be red But it won't be There is not a good world This HTML file is also running It doesn't know about this CSS file Now, what is going on in my house? What does my neighbor know? Now, I have made lentils here And I expect My neighbor has made rice And I expect I can eat it with it It doesn't happen You can eat it sometimes But, I understand What am I saying? So, I will have to link you I will have to link you You have to go and tell your neighbor That I will eat it with you I am making lentils You will have a hand shake So, how will that hand shake be? In HTML, you will tell where is your CSS file? So, there is a link tag And the reason for not using notepad You will know here As soon as I write the link Here is the link colon CSS As soon as I select it Look here It has done half of my work It has also written RL is equal to the style sheet I have to type this manually in notepad This is the syntax of HTML I have to write it But automatically It has come Now, style.css is my destiny It is also called style.css It is the file and it is also called style.css If it is called Harry.css Then I would have written Harry.css here And guess what? Now, my background is red Now, if I want the color of my text to be white So, I can write the color text here I can write here Color white Now, nothing will work here I have written color white Look here, this is white The valid CSS syntax will work there And we will talk about it later in this course So, this is our work Which was our CSS Now, how will this JavaScript work? If I write here alert And I write here Welcome to Sigma Web Development Course Suppose I write here Welcome to Sigma Web Development Course So, what will be the alert here? Why did not the alert come? I will tell you that this syntax is absolutely correct There is no problem in the syntax And I will read the JavaScript very well So, don't worry What did I write?

Amit is a plugin Which is built-in in VS Code You will automatically complete the selection Now, I am writing script here And I am selecting the column SRC This means that I want to give a source file You can type it manually But the suggestions you are getting here Are the powers to write your code They make you a wonderful developer And they increase your powers So that you can't get into trouble And as soon as possible, your Azure developer can be automatically SRC is equal to Script.js You can see here I have included it Now, I will come here So, you see here Welcome to Sigma Web Development Course Everyone write in the comment I have been automatically Write Because I know that you have been automatically By looking at this box Javascript also went away CSS also went away Javascript also went away Now, you will be automatically I will reload it It will come again Okay, it will be closed So, as soon as I visit this website I will get to see an alert here It is called alert Javascript I will tell you what Javascript is Don't say that you didn't tell me I don't want to start weirdly I will finish the HTML Then, Javascript in CSS So, don't take any tension And along with this The best practices I am telling you as soon as possible You have to keep in mind that What I am telling you It is coming from my experience It is coming from my time experience And definitely will help you Like I said, live server You can use it if you want Nothing wrong in that Use it live preview From Microsoft Okay, awesome Now, I want you all to write Sigma batch OP in the comment Everyone is enjoying the course So, put Sigma batch OP in the comment It will be fun to see Yes, this is a batch It is free course It is a batch So, Sigma course OP Write the hashtag It will be fun Now, there were many people's comments in the last video How to do this mouse wheel So, you have to go to the settings You have to write mouse wheel And here you have to check the editor The mouse wheel zoom Then, you have to press control From the mouse wheel I have pressed control As I will do it I will be able to zoom in And if I right click here To do command palette Then I can toggle the screencast mode Then whatever I write here You will get to see that I did not toggle the screencast mode in this video Because you already know What I am typing Okay So, I can toggle the screencast mode Or not, I can turn on The bottom of the screen I am doing all the things that I am doing In the last video We talked about how websites work And what we did You understood very well Now, I will take the example of iPhone 15 Pro Max And I will show you by ordering How the client-server interaction will be Whenever a user orders an iPhone Okay, so you will find it interesting I will show you here So, guys, how the website works here I have come to explain it on Apple.com Now, Apple.com is a website Okay, from their servers Data will be here Okay, whatever the HTML files are I will click here on pre-order And after that, I will simply When I am recording It is not even here, by the way They are saying that it will be here by September I will select 15 Pro Max Let's take any color Let's take Black Titanium What is going on Let's take 250GB Let's take No Trading No Apple coverage After this, you see here What did they do?

video I want you all to go to this video And go to this video In the comment section Post the initial review I want you all to write in the comment section Of this first video How did you like the course And give me 5 stars Do star rating this course And tell me about the initial review I know that the course is not that good But what quality And all these things I am commenting on you all In the first video So if you will do this I will feel good from the heart Go to the first video Read this course Now we will talk After doing this course How you can earn money The first way to earn money from web development It is very simple You do freelance Freelance as a web developer You make websites There are many websites Which you can make And after making them You will get a lot of good money Many people integrate APIs And by integrating APIs Many people earn a lot of money Many people say 4GBT has come So 4GBT has come Then nothing will happen Everything is 4GBT But this is not true 4GBT is an easy way for you to make websites According to me And when you use 4GBT You become a giga chat developer So use more than 4GBT And you can save your time In fact, I tell the truth Since 4GBT has come I am able to deliver more To my freelancing clients As many websites I had to make from the beginning I do more than half of the work I do with 4GBT And the work which 4GBT is not able to do I do that Finally I package it And I don't have to answer anyone What I used 4GBT What I did without 4GBT You can deliver everything very easily Use 4GBT You can't do everything with 4GBT You have to use 4GBT And after that You have to deliver the freelance clients From where you will meet freelancing clients You can go to a website like Fiverr Yes, I know that it is difficult to get work on Fiverr But you can go to the buyer request There is a buyer request option in Fiverr Search it Now if you go here You can match it with buyer If I show you images Then here You can get some buyer requests You can give your pitch to them That I have done this And to do this You will get work It will start Like on your gig You will get good reviews You will earn more money Suppose there is a gig of Fiverr No one has ordered it Then you will never get easy work But if you agree on one gig 5-6 people have ordered And everyone gave you 5 stars Then things will be easier for you Because the buyers They want the ones who are working Their credibility should be good So that they also need work And they are also giving money So they also want If they are giving money Then their money is not wasted So here Fiverr Upwork And also a lot of freelancing websites You can try on them But before trying You should make good websites And today in the day Responsive Use cutting edge technologies Suppose you want to integrate 4GPTI You will get this kind of work No one will tell you Make me a design Make it simple Make it new I am saying most of the clients Do not do all this work For today, everyone does 4GPTI You can make complex websites And earn more money Then another thing Get a job as a web developer If you get a job as a web developer Which if you become a good web developer Then you will get a job And this is not the case Jobs will decrease In fact Senior developers' demand is increasing And their back edge is also increasing People are earning more in coding Than they used to earn If you are a very basic developer Then you will get 4GPTI replaced After this You can sell your services By making an Instagram account In an Instagram account If you upload any kind of images And if you take a little traction Where you talk about websites About all these things Then you start approaching clients I approach many clients Because they say I want to make a website I am not
