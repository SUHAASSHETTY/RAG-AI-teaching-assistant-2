The topic of form and input tags in forms is taught in video 3 of the course. Specifically, you can find this information between the timestamps 443.92 and 452.92. 

To access this topic, I recommend going to video 3 and forwarding to the 443.92 timestamp. The instructor explains how to copy the source code for forms into the HTML forms page and start creating and modifying your form. 

If you're looking for more information on HTML structure, you can also review the section between 403.92 and 414.92 in the same video, where the instructor discusses the basic structure of an HTML website and attributes like "lang" equal to "en". 

For a comprehensive understanding, please navigate to video 3 and follow along with the instructor's explanation.
