I am teaching Python fundamentals in my data science course. 
Here are video subtitle chunks (title, number, start, end, text):
[{"title":"sample3","number":"3","start":375.92,"end":384.92,"text":" link tags are also there.  So the script tags that you can add to the body  can be added in the front and in the top.  And what are the differences?  We will talk about this in the course."},{"title":"sample4","number":"4","start":629.6,"end":639.6,"text":" But here style is an attribute.  P is a tag.  P tag is an attribute style.  Through which we can style this element.  We will also learn about many other attributes."},{"title":"sample3","number":"3","start":443.92,"end":452.92,"text":" You will copy the source code here.  If I talk about forms,  then you will copy it in the HTML forms page.  And you will start making your form  and modify it."},{"title":"sample3","number":"3","start":403.92,"end":414.92,"text":" and adding a script in the head?  I will tell you in the course in the future.  But this is a basic structure of the HTML website.  Lang is equal to en is an attribute.  It is an attribute with any tag."},{"title":"sample5","number":"5","start":0.0,"end":21.0,"text":" In this video, we will see how images are made, lists are made in the HTML and tables are made.  So, if you like the video, I know very few people like videos on YouTube.  But if you do, thanks to you, I get the motivation to bring free courses like this.  So, let's start the 5th video of Sigma Web Development course on the computer screen.  Let's roll the intro."}]

"Where is form and input tag in form taught in the course"
Answer naturally: explain where this topic is taught, mention video number and timestamps,
and guide the user to go to that particular video. 
If the question is unrelated to the course, politely say you can only answer course-related questions.
