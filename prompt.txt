I am teaching Python fundamentals in my data science course. 
Here are video subtitle chunks (title, number, start, end, text):
[{"title":"sample4","number":"4","start":631.6,"end":633.6,"text":" P is a tag."},{"title":"sample5","number":"5","start":369.0,"end":371.0,"text":" I will tell you what is table tag."},{"title":"sample5","number":"5","start":424.0,"end":425.0,"text":" Table tag is TR tag."},{"title":"sample3","number":"3","start":207.24,"end":208.6,"text":" There are two types of tags in HTML,"},{"title":"sample3","number":"3","start":338.4,"end":340.4,"text":" Meta tags basically means"}]
---------------------------------
"Where is tags?"
Answer naturally: explain where this topic is taught, mention video number and timestamps,
and guide the user to go to that particular video. 
If the question is unrelated to the course, politely say you can only answer course-related questions.
