    "text": " In this video, we will start the Sigma Web Development course. Like it with high energy because in this video, I am going to take you from zero and make you a profitable web developer. This course will be modern because web development has changed over time. A lot of new things have come. A lot of things have come in JavaScript which makes the work very easy. A lot of technologies have come which will make your work very easy. This course will be for those who don't know anything. You know that it is zero for you if you know about web development. We will start from zero but we will raise the bar like anything. What will we learn in this course? I will tell you in a few days. Web development is a very profitable thing. I have personally earned a lot of money through web development. And I believe that you can also learn web development quite successfully. During the course, you will get notes, cheat sheets, references, all these things. This course is going to be a little different because in this course, I will tell you the technologies that you should learn as much as you want. And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies. There will be course content, complete web development, front end, back end, database. I will teach you as much as you want to learn. I will tell you the course content in a few days. But you guys keep in mind that you will be a full stack developer. In the future, you will be given a lot of projects during the course. And in the end of the course, we will make some good projects. So that you can be very strong on web development. According to me, project based learning is the best way to learn. So I will make you a lot of projects. And if you agree, then write it in the comment section below. I agree. Because when you comment, my face gets a smile. So do comment. I want to make you believe that after finishing this course, you can make any kind of website from the beginning to the end. And during this course, I will make you a lot of websites like this. So that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with the first video of our Sigma web development course. Let's roll the intro. And I guess I have come to my computer screen. And now as I am doing, you guys follow me. I have downloaded Google Chrome browser here. You also download Google Chrome browser. I am not saying that it won't work. But you guys have to do exactly what I am doing here. So here we will follow you as I am doing. And along with that, you will be able to follow the videos as you come. I will go to Google quickly. And I will write you down. Download VS Code. Now what is VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If you are in Windows, then I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system, then you can download it for that strange operating system. And the process is exactly the same. You can see that my downloads folder is here. And as you can see here, this setup has been downloaded. I have downloaded it. I have downloaded it. I have downloaded it. And as you can see here, this setup has been downloaded. I will refresh it here. And here, you can double click on VS Code setup. So simply, you have to install VS Code. Install the game as easy as possible. You can quickly agree here. This, slice, and slice, and do this, do this, do this, do this. Do this, do this, do this, do this. Damages. And after that, I will accept the agreement and accept it. You also read it like me. And I am the fastest reader in the world. Oh my God! Next, next, next. It is important to check both the icons here. Check both the icons. It is very important to check. If you want a desktop shortcut, meaning if you want to get a shortcut in the desktop, then create a desktop icon. And after that, next, then install. If your PC is fast like me, then it will be so fast. But if your PC is a little slow, then there is no problem. Then install it slowly. This is the way to do it. There is no problem with this. Now, I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel. Because I want you to follow these videos. I want you to follow them. Like I am putting a video here. You get a notification. So, if you want to follow this course completely, ideally you should subscribe. With that said, our VS code is downloaded. I have opened my VS code. Don't be afraid of this. Beginners, don't be afraid of this. And I am saying this again. If you know something already, but we will raise the bar like anything in the upcoming video. So stay tuned. I will also request you to tell me in the comments section what is your level? Is it beginner, advanced, or intermediate user? Tell me in the comments section, where does web development come from? Beginner, advanced, intermediate. Please do comment this. Now, what is VS code here? Why have I downloaded it? If you don't know what is VS code, let me tell you that VS code is a code editor. Which helps you to edit code. Now, you can edit the code in the node pad. So, yes, do it in the node pad. It will also be done in that. Yes, I am not doing it in the sarcastic way. Let's set it up here. And let me show you what is in it. Which makes it a little different from the node pad. Look here, we will set it up quickly. I will not do the color themes here. In fact, I will do it. I will keep the theme dark modern here. And I have done all this. Next section. Next section. You can also close it. But first, I am telling you some tips here. That's it. The VS code here has started. This is the VS code screen. You can see here, you can make a new file. You can make a new folder. But I will recommend you to close it. Yes, you close it. Why have you closed it? I am going to make a new folder here. And I am going to keep it in its name. You guessed it right. Sigma web development course. You can do everything. You can understand everything. You can do everything related to the course. You can shift here and do it right. If there is an app in Windows. You can see here, there is an option called open with code. This option of open with code. This particular folder. It helps you to open it in VS code. You will select it here. Now what you will do here? You will say, yes, I trust this file. You click here and authorize this. And this folder is now open. You can write here. I have written here index.html. Write it now. If you don't know what I am writing. Write it. Enter it. And what I will do here? I will write here. Hey, I am your first HTML file. I have written here. Here you can see a button. This button means that you haven't saved this file. Save it by doing it. If you click on the control, it will be saved. I will recommend you to go to the file. You can also enable auto save option. As soon as you type, it will not be visible. Your files will be instantly saved. As soon as you type. I will recommend this. We will not use control s. Otherwise, if you want to save it from control s, you can disable this option. One more thing I would like you to do. Click on gear. Click on settings. Search here mouse. Now you see here editor mouse wheel zoom. Check it. I will tell you what it is. Now you don't have to worry about the VS code. Why VS code? What is it? What is this? You don't have to see this. Now you will simply scroll by pressing control. So what happens? Your font size changes. I will show you a magic. It is very simple logic. In downloads, there is a sigma web development course. What happened in the folder name. This file is made. Index.html. Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. I will make this.txt file. I will write this is this. What will happen? This folder and this VS code are going in sync. I will open this file from here. I will show you. This is my file. I can do that too. That is my wish. I will not open this. Because there are some things in VS code. Which I don't get notepad. And I want to get those features. I don't want to overrun you. But I will show you. What is there in VS code that you don't get notepad. If I write here.html. If I enter. It automatically gives me the opening closing tag. If I click on exclamation mark. It gives me a boilerplate template. I will click on it. The basic code of html is here. I will talk about it later. Don't overrun it. But I want to tell you. What is the benefit of VS code. Why didn't we use notepad or VS code. And this feels. The good feeling is coming. The feeling of the developer. That is also important. Then there will be a confidence to do coding. For Mac and Linux users. I want to comment here. Exactly similar things are going to happen for you. I am using windows. Linux Mac and windows 3 can't be used together. So exactly the same things will be there for you. In fact, I should say similar things. Exactly the same things will be there. Very similar things. You will be able to follow along. Very easily. Don't worry. I will tell you about some extensions. You will enjoy it. You will also use those extensions. You will also say what I recommended. But I will tell you in a while. And this is criminally underrated. I will tell you about it. You will right click here. Click on command palette. There are many options for VS code. You don't need to know all these options. As we will move forward in the course. The features that will come in use. I will tell you about it. And you can use it. But now I will toggle the screen cast mode. You don't have to do it. But I will do it. So you will know. I clicked. I will type any type. If I click caps lock. You will know when I clicked. This is not relevant for you. But I just want to tell you. Screen cast mode. Screen cast mode. You can change the settings here. Now you see the screen cast mode. Vertical offset. Vertical offset. If I set the vertical offset to zero. It came up. If I set the vertical offset to 70. If I set the vertical offset to 60. If I set the vertical offset to 80. If I set the vertical offset to 80. It came up. From bottom. I set the vertical offset to zero. I will type any type. I will do this. It will look like this. I will close the settings tab. This is the tab. You have tabs in Chrome. You have tabs exactly. I hope you have known. I forgot about the tab. I will tell you step by step. What exactly is it. You can also close the page of VS Code. If you want to zoom in to VS Code. I will do it. I am recording the video. I am showing you the video. I am doing it because I am recording the video. Ideally I want you to see it from the past. Ideally I want you to see it from the past. But when I am doing my coding. I don't zoom in that much. So this is related to VS Code. I want to tell you how websites work. How websites work. A website basically. Works through three types of people. Imagine three people. One is Client. One is Server. One is Client. One is Server. One is Browser. Who is also called Babu. Browser. What is Client? What is this server? I am a browser user. Who is a browser user? This is Chrome. I am a Client. I will tell you from Client. When I write CodeWithHarry.com I write CodeWithHarry.com I tell this browser to give me codewithHarry.com website. Or I write YouTube.com I tell you to give me YouTube.com website. I tell you to give me YouTube.com website. I want to watch YouTube. Browser says you want YouTube. Here. I will enter YouTube.com. So I have brought YouTube.com from the server. I have brought YouTube.com. Do you understand? He has passed the server. He has passed the server. He has shown me this screen. This work happened so fast. Because my internet.com is very fast. My internet speed is very fast. People are faster these days. But still according to my locality it is very fast. With this fast internet speed all these things are very fast. Client server sends a request through browser. Browser is my assistant. I will do the same with browser. It will help me to bring this web page from the server. Who is managing the server? The server is managing YouTube.com. The server is managing YouTube.com. And there is a code written in the server. Which sends me this kind of code. When I write YouTube.com this code came. How to convert this code into this? This is the work of the browser. How to show me this work? Client browser says give me YouTube.com. Browser says you want YouTube.com. I will ask YouTube.com. Then the browser goes to the server. It sends a request to the server. The server will give it. It will say no. Or error. Or server error. Whatever the response is. Ideally it should be 200. With that response the browser comes back to the client. And shows this kind of page. I hope you have cleared this. Client browser has a browser. This is how it works. This is a little more important. Any website. Client browser says give me Google.com. Browser says I want Google.com. I will ask the server. The server goes to the browser. And it takes Google.com. With Google.com the server sends all the images. All the videos. All these icons. The URL of these icons is also written in this code. And the browser displays it correctly. The server sends the browser a bundle. This kind of bundle. And passing this bundle. This is how the browser works. The user will interact further. With this page the browser will get an additional request. If I write and inspect. And then go to the network. And here I write. Harry Bhai. So many requests have been sent for this. And many more requests. As you interact. You will have to send the browser an additional request. So by combining the tools. Consider it as a restaurant. You have given an order. Like you have given an order. A waiter took your order. And then went to the kitchen. And then sent it to the kitchen. And then finally the kitchen gave the order. So what did the waiter do? The browser is working. The waiter gave you the order. Maybe he couldn't make it in the order kitchen. Maybe he couldn't make it in the order kitchen. It is very less that you have to order something. And you didn't get it. But it happens sometimes. Similarly here also sometimes it happens. This error is seen. This is not working. So this kind of error is seen. Even then it is told. But ideally 200. Means it gets a response. And you get this kind of web page. So you can consider it as a restaurant. So whenever you write. Google.com slash mail. You can write code with ari.com slash contact. So code with ari.com slash contact. If it is available then it will show you. If it is not available then it will show you. Or 500 error. So you will see a 500 page. So you will see whatever server it will send. So this cycle is going on. The client sent a request. The browser sent the server. The server then processed the request. After this the server sent the data back. And whatever data was sent the browser showed the client. Then the client did something. The server sent something. Whatever data the server sent the client. The browser returned and so on. So now you will say this is fine. But what is the backend? The backend is processing the server. Now if you believe that you have a blog. There is a lot of data in the blog. So what will you do? You will store every web page of the blog. Or you will generate that content dynamically. Or you will generate that content dynamically. I will take an example of Google. If I search Harry by Search. You can see that the Google header. These are the links. This format does not change. If I write here. Shubham. I have written Shubham here. So I will write Shubham here. Now see that when I wrote Harry by. I am showing a similar content of that. So what does Google do? The backend of the server. The backend processes the data. So that it can send that HTML for corresponding query. So when I write Shubham. When I write Harry. So this is the way to generate this. So this is the backend. Now this backend can be Jango. This backend can be Flask. This backend can be Node. This backend can be PHP. This backend can be Ruby on Rails. And the database in the backend. The backend code is not visible to the client. This is the front end code. And the server sends it. And how did the server send this code? We don't know how the server made this code. Because it is running on the server. If you are confused. Don't be confused. We will see the backend. Now we understand how the front end works. The front end is primarily made with three languages. HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These three languages. Which you need. If you are making a website. Every website needs HTML, CSS, JavaScript. In most of the cases. If you only need HTML. If you only use HTML. Then it is a basic skeleton. It is made of web site. After that when you use CSS. You can style it. Like this button is visible. Then only CSS is visible. Along with that. This button is red. This button is curve. This is all the help of CSS. You can see the edges. This is all the help of CSS. So CSS works. What happens after you do it. All these works are done through CSS. There is a beauty of CSS. HTML page. HTML is a constant body of any page. This is a standard. Anyone who makes a website. Will make it on HTML. So that the browser can understand how to parse. The browser works. Parse HTML. And HTML is a skeleton. It is a standard. Anyone who makes a website. This is a standard. This is a standard. So that everyone makes the same pages. And if someone is making a browser. Then you have to parse the same language. If you have learnt 80% HTML. Then you are good to go for web development. Now there are some things directly from HTML. Like if I write a lot of HTML codes. So I am writing some HTML codes. I have used the emitter abbreviation. I have written some HTML codes. I have written some HTML codes. I have written some HTML codes. I will write this as HTML. And I can open this HTML file. I can open this HTML file directly. And as soon as I open this HTML file. I will open this HTML file. You see this will open like this. I can open this directly. Actually double click here. And it opened. This is HTML. But this is not styled. This HTML file is very basic. You can run videos directly from HTML. I have an HTML file. I will show you the video. I will show you the video. I will show you the video. So there is a video tag in HTML. If you enter the video. Then the video you will put in the SRC will be played. Like if I put video1.mp4 here. You see VS Code automatically showed me video1.mp4. This is the benefit of using VS Code. So you see here. I will reload it. So here this video is automatically seen. I can play it. To play I will have to write controls here. I will refresh it. So I will have controls to play. I can play. This is a permission. To sell it. This is the need of the person. How much do you want? 130 crores. If I put video2.mp4 here. I have put video1 here. I have two more videos. I have some other videos here. If I put it here. And after that I will refer them. If I put video2.mp4 here. Then video2 will be seen. I will reload it. If you put video2.mp4 here. Then you can see the people. What is this? This was the lookalike of Ben Stokes. If I do video3 here. I know I will do video3 here. So my third video will be played. So I will reload it. And you see I can play it. This is the third video. I have played video3.mp4 here. So I will close it. And we can play video4 too. And I have video4.mp4 here. And I have video4.mp4 here. Where DJ is playing. So you see. Chaburna. Pichiru ko. Pichiru ko. Pichiru ko. You can make such things. You can use only html. You don't need to do anything else. You can play videos only with html. You can play images only with html. You can play images only with html. Now if you want to style it. Suppose I want a border. Or a red background. Then what I have to do for that. I have to use CSS for that. CSS adds beauty on any website. Then comes JavaScript. Which adds interaction. For example. What will happen when I click on search. What will happen when I write code with hr. Like code with hr. And here auto complete. Why did it come. Because on a request server. And for this query. The results of auto complete came here. So all these things are from JavaScript. We call this Client Side Scripting. We want to do scripting here. We want to do coding here. We can do it on the client side. We can do it with the help of JavaScript. This is the brain. So our website becomes beauty with brain. I am talking about the website. Beauty with brain. CSS adds beauty. And brain came from JavaScript. Now JavaScript helps you to make the page dynamic. Like without loading the page. If you want to change the content. Then all this is done with JavaScript. There are a lot of mosquitoes here. So I will kill these mosquitoes. Oh my God. The mosquitoes are not doing anything here. My racket is working. Oh my God. Like the video. Because I eat current chettke for you. I am going to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript. First learn 100% HTML. Then learn 100% CSS. Until you remember all the properties. But this expression is wrong. Why wrong? Because HTML you only 80%. And CSS you only 40% 60%. And JavaScript you only 50% 70%. You can learn 50% 70%. You can start web development. You can make projects. And make and make and make. In the next course I will tell you about Chat GPT and web development. What impact to chat GPT. We will also talk about this. You are watching Tune. So don't run behind perfection. Don't think that I will do 1 year of HTML. I will do CSS in next year. Then I will do JavaScript in 30 years. Then I will make projects in 4 years. Don't think that. Do HTML 80%. CSS 40% 60%. And JavaScript 50% 70%. And as you will keep making websites. Your experience will teach you more HTML. More CSS. And you will not know. You must have perfected HTML CSS. While you are making money. And working as a professional web developer. So you will be earning along with learning. And you will be improving your skills. So don't think that I will remember all the HTML tags. Then I will make a website. Then I will remember all the CSS properties. Then I will make a website. Then I will teach you this. I will teach you this. I will teach you that. So you will learn what matters. And I don't want you to learn all the time. So I designed this course. So that you can learn only what matters. And you will learn the rest. And I will make you do a lot of practice in this course. Here we have 2-4 mosquitoes to learn sigma web development course. Which is good. Our audience is increasing. In this course we will learn HTML first. Then CSS and JavaScript. And I will tell you such tricks in this course. I will not listen to any of these tricks. And I have learned different points and tricks of my career. I will tell you all about this in this course. I have learnt some amazing tricks in my career. And I want you to learn all the tricks. And I want you to learn all the tricks. Now if you have any doubts in this course. In the upcoming videos. Then you can use the hashtag doubt. And ask your doubts. I am going to try to answer all the doubts. I will try. I will try my best to solve your doubts. So if you have any question. Don't forget to ask your doubts in the comments. Please write your doubts without the hashtag. Please write your doubts in the comments. Please write your doubts without the hashtag. So that I can prioritize the comments. So that I can prioritize the comments. I will try to answer all the doubts. As much as I can. And you will learn everything in this course. So like this course. If you have not done it. That will bring a smile on my face. Now what is this react. What is this next gs. This is the framework of HTML. This helps you to use JavaScript. That is HTML CSS JavaScript is a website. This process helps you to make it fast. How we will learn this course. Yes. We will learn in this course. We will learn in this course. I told you that I will make this course. I will make you to take you from zero. I will take you to the hero in web development. Take your seat's belly. Because you have taken the ticket of Sigma web development express. A very good analogy. I want to give you all. To teach you JavaScript. HTML is like car skeleton. If you paint it in CSS. And if you put it in internal engine car. That is JavaScript. As an example of a human. The skeleton is HTML. If you put skin on it. Then CSS. And brain is like that. You have a nervous system. Now I will take you to phobes.com. As soon as you go to phobes.com. You see here. Phobes.com is a website. Which uses HTML CSS in JavaScript. Like any other website. If I click on right click. If I click on inspect. Then this inspect element is opened. Now here you see. They have used script in the head. And here to add CSS. They have used link. So what I will do here. I will remove their CSS. So to remove CSS. I will clear all their style text. I will clear them. By using delete key. So as soon as I remove all the style text. And as soon as I remove all the link text. So as soon as I delete all their style sheets. See what the condition of this page is. This page is showing something like this. They have only raw HTML. What size of images should be. What kind of images should be. They have forgotten all this. And only raw HTML is written here. Which is not styled at all. So the condition of phobes.com is something like this. It is showing something like this. Raw links are showing something like this. And similarly here. I can remove the script accent. And see without the JavaScript website. Now if I delete the HTML tag of this page. Like this. I have deleted all the head. So this is a blank page. Without HTML. So this is the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To make a web page. I would like to tell you one thing. This course was initially made to be paid. I converted it to free course. And I thought I will put it on YouTube. So I want you all to be serious. Many people have reached out to me. To launch paid course. But I could hear a voice from my heart. I should keep this course free. Because when I learnt web development. I can understand when you don't have a course to learn well. And you don't have the affordability to buy a paid course. So I can understand. And I decided that this is a Sigma web development course. It should be absolutely free. This course is free. As you all will earn crores in the coming time. You will earn crores. I am going to give you all the fees. This is our agreement in this video. So when you earn crores. And you earn lakhs after this course. So send me a green leaf. But you have to do this when you start earning well. Only after you start earning good. So while keeping this aside. In the next video I will tell you how you can earn money. To complete this course. But I will add light on this. This is also an important day. How will you earn money. That is also important. I will do freelancing. I will tell you everything in this course. I want to tell you some action items. The first action item is that you can access this course. The playlist which I will give you in the description. Everyone bookmark that playlist. Press the star button here. And then press the star button. And then click on the bookmark. And save the button. Now many of you have said that we will buy a paid course. Thank you so much for all the support. I am sure you all love me. I am sure you all trust me. But this course is going to be free. No technical issues should come. I am putting these videos in the resolution of 1080p. So you all should watch it clearly. But those people say that it is in SD. It is in video 240p and 144p. You all watch Bali's Wadhu. You watch the video of your mobile. You watch the video of your mobile. And then you tell me that these are your videos. This is not HD. Call a city of Bali. So I hope you all understood what is the request. What is the response. How do these websites work. We got a basic idea. How is client-server interaction. In the upcoming videos we will see how the website is made. We are going to make our first website in the next video. So you should be excited. Because our first website is going to be in the next video. And maybe some of you are the first website. So access the playlist. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you in the next video. See you next time."
