And I will name these files Video1. And I will move these files in Video1 folder. I am not pushing this video on the Git. You can use your sample videos. So now I will update the source code here. And I will push it on the Git. How to push it on the Git. You guys don't need to learn this. But this procedure is very simple. Why do we use Git? I would like to tell you that the Git is used by web developers. We use general coders. When they have to collaborate with their code. Then they have to collaborate with other people. So what will happen is that you guys will work with many programmers. And those programmers will collaborate with your source code. And to do this kind of collaboration. They will also push some code. You will also push some code. Maybe a person is editing a file. A person is editing a second file. So here the GitHub is used. And what is GitHub Desktop? GitHub Desktop is a utility to use Git. Git and GitHub have this difference. Git is an open source. But GitHub is a Microsoft open source. But GitHub is a Microsoft open company. Which is used by using Git. And helps you to host repositories on your web interface. And helps you to host repositories on your web interface. In the upcoming videos about Git. I will tell you more. But I am pushing this repository on my code with her. So you will get the link in the description. The repository. So as soon as I give you the links. You will get the code if you follow it. And I will talk about it later. I am making this video course impact. Like this. So I will click on the Publisher repository. This code. This folder will sync with my GitHub account. So the whole code that I am going to upload. Will go to my GitHub account. And it will sync. The changes here will be there. If someone has changed there. I can pull it here. I can pull it here. I will teach you all this. I will dedicate a video. Don't worry. I will make a video 2 folder. I will go to the inside. I will click on Shift and open with VS Code. So here is open with code. You will get this option. As I said. If you have changed something. And you have not checked. You can have a problem. We will dismiss this. I will make the file here. I will make the index. And that file will be made here. So you all know about it. I know a lot of intermediate people here. We already know everything. But I am making this course. So that all the beginners can follow along. So I will make 3 files here. One I made here. The second file I am going to make. Style.CSS And the third file I am going to make. Script.js And the name of these files can be anything. But I just want to keep these files self-explanatory. So that they can see the name and know what they are doing. Index.HTML file. Script.js. And this is the style sheet. So I made these 3 files here. I will go to index.html and apply the exclamation mark. And as soon as I apply the exclamation mark. You see here this code is here. I will click on view word wrap. So that you can see the code. Horizontal scroll bar is gone. I checked the word wrap. So here you all see. We will understand this code. But for now you can understand that this code. The code of HTML. We use it to make a website. Now let's go to the extension tab of VS Code. For extensions. To enhance the functionality of VS Code. We use extension code to make VS code better. For VS Code, we use code to write. To make it more helpful. So which extension will we use? I will put you in the first one. Some extensions which will make our VS code clearer. If your friend has seen it. He will say yeah. Okay. I will go to the second one. I will do it quickly, VS Code Icons VS Code Icons is an extension called KEEK, which I will install As you know, whatever files you are looking at, it has an icon Earlier, this icon was not available, you can see it in the video Here, you are getting to see all these icons Thanks for installing VS Code Icons I will activate it here And you can see here that these are our icons If you consider that I have made a folder at the time of coming, then this icon will come So, these icons look so good We will come to the extension tab again And here, there are many good themes that you can use Some themes are Jellyfish themes One is GitHub themes, there are many themes You can use these themes, but I can only apply one theme at a time This is the theme of default VS Code, which shows you VS Code in this way Now, if I change my theme, then my VS Code will look in a different way I will show you which one I will prefer when it comes to themes First, I will show you the GitHub theme here This is an official GitHub theme Here, you can see GitHub Dark Here, you can see GitHub Light Here, you can see GitHub DIMMED Here, you can see GitHub Colour Blind I think this one looks better because the colors in this one Sorry, I will choose GitHub Dark because the colors in this one are different Another theme that I will prefer is Jellyfish And here, Jellyfish theme looks good If I install this, then you can see something like this Jellyfish, this is how you see After this, a material theme is also very popular And if I use the material theme here And the material theme icon is the material theme that we have to install If you have installed the material theme icon, then you can change your icons To control which extension And here, we have installed many extensions You can also tell how to delete extensions Here, I am showing the material theme icons And if you want, you can use the VSCode icons If I want, the material themes icon to be removed Then I will simply remove this And here, you can see all my extensions This is the material theme icon And I want to use this one And if I want, I can also uninstall it And sometimes, if we uninstall anything, then reload is required So, I will have to click on reload required And when I click on reload required, then my VSCode will be reloaded So, you can customize your VSCode I will select my VSCode icons here So that I can see my icons like this I like this a little I like Jellyfish theme a lot After this, there is another extension called Prettier I will not install it too But I just want to tell you Another extension is ES7 When we react, you will know And yes, we will react in this course For all those asking Sorry for the spoilers, but we are going to react in this course So, this is ES7 plus ReactRedux React Native Snippets This extension gives you a React Snippets We will use it only when we react We will not install it for now But now, the most important extension is called Live Preview We will install this extension called Live Preview Because it is a very useful extension I have told you all the extensions Mostly, they help you To change the look and feel of the VSCode But today, I am telling you the extension Live Preview, you will actually use it Let's come to our HTML CSS JavaScript files So, these are our HTML CSS and JavaScript files This is HTML file This is some code Which tells you How to see the website Okay So, here I am saying that Document should be in the title I will write here Harry's first website Harry's first website K-Course's first website Harry's first website will be a

one which we have installed live server Live Preview, sorry Live server used to work a lot But Microsoft released Live Preview So, I will recommend the latest extension Live server works too But I am not going to run Live Server I am going to use Live Preview After installing Live Preview You can see this icon here But if you click on it Your website will look something like this Now you say, I

the first video So if you will do this I will feel good from the heart Go to the first video Read this course Now we will talk After doing this course How you can earn money The first way to earn money from web development It is very simple You do freelance Freelance as a web developer You make websites There are many websites Which you can make And after making them You will get a lot of good money Many people integrate APIs And by integrating APIs Many people earn a lot of money Many people say 4GBT has come So 4GBT has come Then nothing will happen Everything is 4GBT But this is not true 4GBT is an easy way for you to make websites According to me And when you use 4GBT You become a giga chat developer So use more than 4GBT And you can save your time In fact, I tell the truth Since 4GBT has come I am able to deliver more To my freelancing clients As many websites I had to make from the beginning I do more than half of the work I do with 4GBT And the work which 4GBT is not able to do I do that Finally I package it And I don't have to answer anyone What I used 4GBT What I did without 4GBT You can deliver everything very easily Use 4GBT You can't do everything with 4GBT You have to use 4GBT And after that You have to deliver the freelance clients From where you will meet freelancing clients You can go to a website like Fiverr Yes, I know that it is difficult to get work on Fiverr But you can go to the buyer request There is a buyer request option in Fiverr Search it Now if you go here You can match it with buyer If I show you images Then here You can get some buyer requests You can give your pitch to them That I have done this And to do this You will get work It will start Like on your gig You will get good reviews You will earn more money Suppose there is a gig of Fiverr No one has ordered it Then you will never get easy work But if you agree on one gig 5-6 people have ordered And everyone gave you 5 stars Then things will be easier for you Because the buyers They want the ones who are working Their credibility should be good So that they also need work And they are also giving money So they also want If they are giving money Then their money is not wasted So here Fiverr Upwork And also a lot of freelancing websites You can try on them But before trying You should make good websites And today in the day Responsive Use cutting edge technologies Suppose you want to integrate 4GPTI You will get this kind of work No one will tell you Make me a design Make it simple Make it new I am saying most of the clients Do not do all this work For today, everyone does 4GPTI You can make complex websites And earn more money Then another thing Get a job as a web developer If you get a job as a web developer Which if you become a good web developer Then you will get a job And this is not the case Jobs will decrease In fact Senior developers' demand is increasing And their back edge is also increasing People are earning more in coding Than they used to earn If you are a very basic developer Then you will get 4GPTI replaced After this You can sell your services By making an Instagram account In an Instagram account If you upload any kind of images And if you take a little traction Where you talk about websites About all these things Then you start approaching clients I approach many clients Because they say I want to make a website I am not saying that you should have a lot of followers You can start with very little following After this You can give people 1 to 1 help You will get this too You will get this from clients' Instagram Or from social media You can say in your real life If you want to learn anything Then you come to my DM I will tell you or I will tell you And you get clients very easily Trust me if you have any help After this You can sell your course Which I think This course was going to sell I have uploaded it in free But this course was going to get paid The truth is this And when you get this course paid Definitely Everyone gave money for this course It is not necessary that you have to make a web development course There are many things inside web development Like how to use 4GPTI Make a course of it Make a course of 4GPTI If you want to make a website It will be easy to sell your course The course economy is very huge Many people have contacted me To buy this course That I will launch this course as a paid course on their platform But I didn't do it Because I wanted to give this course as free I decided I even posted it People have contacted me till the last moment Please don't put it in free But I put it So you will have to write down the sigma batch in the comment section And you will have to like it Now that the course is uploaded in free Many of the course sellers have been harmed Because when iPhone 15, 16, 19 is being released in free Then who will ask Blackberry That too the paid Blackberry And I am saying this because I have put in so much effort And put in so much experience I know that in the coming videos You will also know So stay tuned You will get a lot of things in the coming videos I am aware of the fact that we are taking a very slow start But remember me We will raise the bar like anything So access the playlist Like the video Do the land of your village in my name Thank you so much guys for watching this video And I will see you next time"
